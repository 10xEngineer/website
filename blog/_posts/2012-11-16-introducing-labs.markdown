As software engineers, we never stop learning. We are always eager to try and experiment with new technology and we’re eternally on the look out for ideas on how we can improve our application design and implementation processes and generally do things much better. We spend a lot of time fiddling with stuff. There are always new problems to solve, new challenges to overcome and new techniques to learn. It's all part of what we do; it’s what makes us tick.

Unfortunately there are countless obstacles that get in the way and waste our time. We lose time figuring out what went wrong with workstations, waiting for new development environment setups, waiting for new server provisioning, waiting for builds, waiting for a new guy to get started, waiting for coffee, waiting for ... you name it, the list is endless!

That's a lot of wasted time and a whole load of pointless frustration. Let's change that! We are 10xEngineer and our goal is to help you to become better software engineers.

Today we are proud to introduce **Labs**, a state-of-the-art platform that has been specifically designed to improve the development lifecycle. Our platform is extremely simple to start with and grows together with your requirements, clever isn’t it? With Labs you no longer have to endure complex processes setting up a local development environment just to get started with new technology. You can simply launch a new Lab Machine and get started in seconds. All it takes is

     % labs launch

and you have your own Linux environment ready to use at your disposal. Checkout code from GIT, implement new functionality, share it with others, revert configuration if needed and dispose of it when you're done. It’s ready for instant use, when you want, where you want it.

But that's just the beginning. Labs provides a perfect way to:

* improve your continuous integration processes with faster runtime of automated tests;
* capture the state of a machine exactly when the error has occurred using snapshots and then quickly and easily share these with others;
* increase dev/test/prod parity with reusable configuration management;
* and much more… 

If you want to check out the new features that will shortly be added to Labs, please take a look at our [public development roadmap](https://trello.com/board/10xengineer-labs-roadmap/5097a804d827a91614014c6e).

Interested? Why don't you launch your first Lab Machine today and let us know what you think? We love feedback and are always looking for a new ways to improve an engineer's day-to-day workflow.
