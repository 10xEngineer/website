As a software engineers, we never stop learning. We try new technology, always looking for better ways how to improve application design and how to implement them better. We spend a lot of time fiddling with stuff. New problems to solve, new challenges to overcome. It's part of what we do, what makes us tick. 

Unfortunately there are countless obstacles that waste our time. Time lost figuring out what went wrong with workstation, waiting for new development environment setup, waiting for new server provisioning, waiting for builds, waiting for a new guy to get started, waiting for ...

That's a lot of time wasted. Lots of pointless frustration. Let's change that! We are 10xEngineer and our goal is to help you to be better as developer. 

Today we are proud to introduce **Labs** - our platform for better development lifecycle, which is simple to start with and grows together with your requirements. With Labs you no longer have to endure complex setup of local development environment just to get started with new technology. Simply launch a new **Lab Machine** and get started in seconds. All it takes is

     % labs launch

and you have your own Linux environment ready at your disposal<sup>1</sup>. Checkout code from GIT, implement new functionality, share it with others, revert configuration if needed, dispose when you're done. Instantly.

But that's just a beginning. Labs provide a perfect way how to 

* improve your Continuous Integration processes with faster runtime of automated tests
* capture the state of a machine with snapshots exactly when the error has occurred and share it with others
* increase dev/test/prod parity with reusable configuration management
* and much more. 

If you want to check new features coming to Labs, please check our public development roadmap.

Interested? Why don't you **launch your first Lab Machine today** and let us know what you think? We love feedback and always looking for a new ways how to improve engineer's day-to-day workflow. 

_If you have read so far, please, make sure you follow us at Twitter/Facebook to be the first to know find out about new features and solutions._

<sup>1</sup>Obviously you have to install Labs CLI client first.
